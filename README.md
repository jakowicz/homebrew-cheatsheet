# homebrew-tap

Homebrew tap for my personal shit. Some of these packages may be tailored towards me specifically, but if that's the case and you'd like to use the package, please raise a PR.

## Setup

```shell
brew tap jakowicz/tap git@github.com:jakowicz/homebrew-tap.git
```

## Use

Any formulas that don't conflict with formulas in the Homebrew master formula, can be installed implicitly:

```shell
brew install recent
brew install cheatsheet
```

Anything that does conflict simply requires prefixing with the tap namespace:

```shell
brew install jakowicz/tap/recent
brew install jakowicz/tap/cheatsheet
```

## Packages

### Cheatsheet

I struggle to remember all the commands I need on a daily basis, so this helps me to remember. I also use [TLDR](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) which is great for when learning new commands. But, this package is meant for my top picks.

### Recent

This tool will read your system account's ~/.zsh_history file and process it, displaying which commands you more frequently run for the program you specify.
